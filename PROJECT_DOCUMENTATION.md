# **Project Proposal**

### <u>**1. Design brief**</u>
### **Provide an overview of your project, including the book you have chosen, the type of user experience you are creating (e.g., website, app, video game), and your target audience.**
\
My project is a video game based on the book series Wings of Fire, and is targeted towards young children to middle aged teenagers. It will be a 2D exploration platform game with multiple levels based on each book in the series. Wings of Fire is a series where each book is in a different character’s POV, so each level will be designed and planned based on what progressed in their book.

### <u>**2. Book choice and Justification**</u>
### **Identify the name of the book and author.**
### **Summarise what the book is about (like a blurb) - 1 paragraph or less.**
### **Explain why you chose this book and how it inspired your project.**
\
Since my game is based on the whole series rather than an individual book, I’ll just explain the whole series.

Wings of Fire is a series of high fantasy novels by Tui. T. Sutherland about dragons, where the series progresses through 3 arcs. The first arc is called the Dragonet Prophecy, where 5 dragonets are destined to save the world from the harsh war destroying each tribe. The second arch is The Jade Mountain Prophecy, where 5 dragonets have to save their school from destruction and death. The third and last arc is The Lost Continent, where a group of dragonets from another continent from the last two arcs are in trouble and have to find help to stop the evil forces that are trying to mind control everyone.

I love Wings of Fire because each book is so different, written specifically for the character POV it’s in. It’s so immersive and gives a lot of insight into the character’s thoughts and options in every book, really including us into their personality. 

The whole Wings of Fire series explores a lot of places, meets a lot of new characters and progresses through many plots. I really want to have a game where each level is inspired by each character, showing the story that they went through in their book. This not only reminds old readers of what happened, but encourages new readers as they travel through multiple levels.

### <u>**3. User experience type**</u>
### **Identify what format your project will take (Website, app, video game, interactive story, etc.).**
### **Explain how this format will enhance the story or themes of the book.**
\
The format of my project is a 2D exploration platform video game made in Unity, and the aim of the game is to progress through each level of each different dragon throughout the series. I chose this format because the Wings of Fire series is so captivating that it would be hard to convey all the great points in an app or website in just words. Being able to play through the characters really shows the reader what they had to experience and achieve through their story and how it results in victory in the end.


### <u>**4. Target market**</u>
### **Identify the intended audience (Age group, interests, reading level, etc.).**
### **Explain why this project will appeal to them.**
### **Explain how your design choices will cater to this audience.**
\
The intended audience for Wings of Fire is young children to teenagers, and for those with an interest in high fantasy settings and characters. The reading level is from 8-11 year olds, but I’ve still been reading (listening) to the books almost everyday because of the incredible writing and character development. The foreshadowing and suspense is very well built, lore about the past is explained clearly, with lots of room to imagine things for yourself. 

My project will appeal to them through the design choices of a small pixelated world with different settings related to the characters. It’s in a simple and cute art style that suits the reading level, as a realistic 3D game is both unfitting and graphic.



### <u>**5. Software and Tools**</u>
### **List the software, platforms, and tools you plan to use (e.g., Adobe XD, Unity, HTML/CSS, video editing software).**
### **Explain why each of the above are suitable for your project.**
\
I will use Unity to create my project as it is a video game, fitting in the adventure and fantasy aspect of the book series. It is easily customisable to fit the theme and can resonate with the users well.

### <u>**6. Initial Brainstorming**</u>
### **Create a three-tiered mind map to outline your ideas.**
### **Identify key themes, design elements, and user interactions relevant to your project.**
### **Evaluate each branch by considering its feasibility, impact, and effectiveness before making design decisions.**

\
The key themes of my game it’s its immersive environmental settings, as each level is designed and based on each novel in the series. It focuses on each character’s journey through their stories, which is why it is very peaceful compared to other 2D platform games. The aim of the game is just to travel through each character’s level to the end, reflecting on the challenges that have happened throughout the books.

I do think that this project will take a few weeks to do, mainly each level uses different elements and backgrounds, but I do believe that this is feasible. I hope that the hard work I put into this project will create a good result and effectively engage players into it.


# **Requirements Outline**
### <u>Functional Requirements</u>
\
**Purpose of the Application**

The video game allows users to experience each character’s story through their book and explore the environment and situations they faced. This application is designed to promote the book through the variety of levels, each a different story, and engage with fans because of the large fanbase that enjoy the series.

**Uses Cases**
\
Users start the game and choose which level to play if they’ve already unlocked it, each labelled with the book and character it is related to. Once in the game, players can pause the game to return to the level page, adjust the volume and restart a level. This lets users have more personalised controls and can leave whenever they want. The game also has a character screen, which is accessed from the splash screen, where players can view all the dragons with a book about them, and a description of that character for old and new fans to read about. Users can also change the background of the main menu to different environments such as underwater, in forests and the desert, to fit with the large variety of settings of the book series.

**Test Cases**
\
Test Case 1: When the user selects ‘Play’, the application will direct them to the ‘Level’ menu.
Testing: Self-Testing
Test Case 2: When the user selects a level, the application will direct them to the level if they have unlocked it.
Testing: Self-Testing
Test Case 3: When the user presses Escape on the keyboard during a game, the pause menu will appear, allowing the user to change their settings or leave.
Testing: Self-Testing
Test Case 4: When the user selects “Dragon Information” in the splash screen, the application will open up a character menu with description of the 15 book protagonists of the series.
Testing: Self-Testing


### <u>Non-Functional Requirements</u>

**Performance**\
The application will be fast and smooth, with the loading time between screens occurring within one second.

**Usability**\
The application will have large readable text with button outlines and bright colours for easy accessibility.

**Reliability**\
The application will be tested across multiple devices and tested to ensure it is consistent and bug free.

**Security**\
The app only collects user data related to the user's progress. The app does not include any login data or user feedback forms.


# **Social, Ethical and Legal Issues**
### <u>Social Impact</u>
* **Target Audience Considerations**\
This application is available for the larger majority of the audience, and is created with accessibilities in mind. There are large texts, clear instructions, simple controls and simple animations to ensure users can play comfortably.
* **Potential Benefits**\
This project positively encourages users to read through the whole series, as it is one huge amazing story broken into arcs and books, each focusing on each character’s journey through obstacles and internal struggles. It will encourage fans to discuss how vast the setting is, with its two continents Pyrrhia and Pantala. It brings attention to the detail Tui. T. Sutherland put into the series for the best immersion for each book, a great topic for fans to talk about, fostering the community of fans for Wings of Fire.
* **Potential Risks**\
Since the book’s setting is in a fantasy world where the story and protagonists are dragons, the designs do not include misrepresentation or exclusion of groups, as the seven dragon tribes all look similar to their respective environment. The book contains some themes in the book of war, family and corrupted ideas for power, but majority of them will not be included in this game, except possibly non-graphic images of a dragon lying on the ground (dead) for extremely important story parts.

### <u>Ethical Responsibilities</u>
* **User Data & Privacy**\
The prototype will only carry user data related to the user’s game progression, which only includes the levels unlocked and collectibles collected. The data will be handled responsibly with private domains to ensure all data is kept secure.
* **Representation & Inclusion**\
This project accurately represents the characters, themes and ideas from the series without any misgenderisation or exclusion. Because of the simplicity of this game, there are limited ideas of each character and level, it will be represented as fairly as possible.
* **Content Sensitivity**\
The book does contain controversial topics such as violence and discrimination but the prototype will not include these because it will be a 2D exploration platform game with no dialogue, so there could be no controversial topics involved as the purpose of the game is to travel through different environments.

### <u>Legal Considerations</u>
* **Copyright & Intellectual Property**\
My project does use book inspirations and images as the spirits are based on the official drawings, and the project’s story will follow the series’ story as well. However, this falls under fair use. I am not earning any money from this nor am I publishing this.

My assets will be inspired by the official drawings, so I will credit the official artist and any other external sources I use.
